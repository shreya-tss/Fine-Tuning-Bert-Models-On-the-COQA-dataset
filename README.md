# Fine-Tuning-Bert-Models-On-the-COQA-dataset
This paper explores the fine-tuning of pretrained
language models for the task of Question Answering (QA)
within a specific domain. The approach focuses on leveraging
the power of state-of-the-art models such as BERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, MobileBERT, TinyBERT, and ELECTRA to address
domain-specific QA challenges. Using a CoQA-like dataset, we
investigate the effectiveness of these models when fine-tuned
on a question-answering task, demonstrating improvements in
accuracy and performance. Our experiments reveal key insights
into the behavior of these models and their ability to adapt to a
specialized domain, using a combination of evaluation metrics
such as Exact Match (EM) and F1 scores. Additionally, we
present visualizations of model performance, token distributions,
and frequent term analysis to better understand their efficiency.
The results show that fine-tuning these models yields significant
improvements over base models, confirming their applicability in
real-world domain-specific QA tasks.
